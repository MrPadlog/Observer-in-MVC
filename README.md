# Observer-in-MVC
A Python 2.7 project in Tkinter, with a MVC structure, where an Observer shall be implemented

18.08.2016: Added the part of the script, which has the MVC structure and an Observer functionality, which in turn does nothing, except existing. The idea is, to use an Observer to watch self.shared_keys in the class PageControl and notify the corresponding variables in the class Model.
